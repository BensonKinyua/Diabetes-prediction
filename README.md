# Diabetes-prediction
## Overview
This data science project aims to develop a predictive model for diabetes based on various health-related features. The project uses machine learning techniques to analyze a dataset containing information about patients and their diabetes status. The model predicts the likelihood of a patient having diabetes, which can be a valuable tool for healthcare providers in early diagnosis and intervention.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

data/: Contains the dataset used for training and testing.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, preprocessing, and model development.
src/: Python source code for the machine learning model.
results/: Store model evaluation results and any visualizations.
## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Meriskill.

The target variable is "Diabetes" (0 for non-diabetic, 1 for diabetic).

## Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is a crucial step to ensure the quality and reliability of the data. It involves handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables. Detailed preprocessing steps can be found in the notebooks/preprocessing.ipynb notebook.

## Model Building
We employ machine learning techniques to build a predictive model. The model is developed in Python using popular libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and others. The model is trained on a portion of the dataset and evaluated using various metrics. The process can be reviewed in the notebooks/model_building.ipynb notebook.

## Evaluation
The model's performance is assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curve. Detailed evaluation results can be found in the results/evaluation_results.txt file.
